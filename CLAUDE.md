- any time I enter a prompt that begins with "Recipe:" (or "recipe:"), it means to do the following:
- analyze all of the recipes in the _recipes folder
- ingest the recipe info pasted along with "Recipe:"
- create a new recipe.md file in the correct format
- I may also follow "Recipe:" with a URL - if so, use the content from the linked recipe to generate the new recipe.md
