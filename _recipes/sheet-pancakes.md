More fluffy with less toil! 

## Ingredients

* Prepare pancake batter according to your favorite recipe – we just use the Bisquick "advanced" recipe at 1.5x (3 cups) for a ¼ sheet pan.


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F

1. Prepare the batter as instructed, and let sit 5m

1. Pour into well-sprayed ¼ sheet pan (NOT the bigger sheet pan)

1. Add toppings of choice - Blueberry Voltron FTW (that's blueberries, sprinkles, oats, and some flax meal)

1. Bake 10min-15min 

1. Slice, serve, enjoy!


### Notes

* **Mix & Match Toppings:** You can do different toppings on different "regions" of the pan, including overlapping them to mix & match! e.g. try left half blueberry / bottom half sprinkles, and you'll end up with 4 different topping quadrants!
