A deliciously tangy cocktail devised as a method to stretch our gorgeous Santa Rosa Plums longer than the ~3 weeks our tree produces for. Once our appetite's can't keep up with the tree's production, we slice & freeze the plums, making them a quick and easy addition to smoothies, or the perfect fruit for this boozy treat.

## Ingredients

- 4 oz. Silver Rum (e.g. Diplomatico Planas or Planteray 3 Stars)
- 2 oz. Lime Juice
- 1 oz. Simple Syrup
- 2 cups frozen sliced plums
- 1 cup ice

## Directions

1. Blend
1. Pour
