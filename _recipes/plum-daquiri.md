A deliciously tangy cocktail devised as a method to stretch our gorgeous Santa Rosa Plums longer than the 3 weeks or so that our tree produces for. Once our appetites can't keep pace, we slice & freeze the plums, making these a quick and easy addition to smoothies or the perfect frozen fruit for this boozy treat.

## Ingredients

- 4 oz. Silver Rum (e.g. Diplomatico Planas or Planteray 3 Stars)
- 2 oz. Lime Juice
- 1 oz. Simple Syrup
- 2 cups frozen sliced plums
- 1 cup ice
