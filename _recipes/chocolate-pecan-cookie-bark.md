A modern take on a classic chocolate-chip-and-nut cookie that gives bakers the leeway to play around with ingredients, flavors and textures. Baking it as a thin sheet gives plenty of room for crispy, almost toffee-like edges & bottoms.

**Total Time:** 45 minutes

**Yield:** Makes 2 to 3 dozen pieces, depending on how you break them up

## Ingredients

* 1 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled
* 100 grams (½ cup) granulated sugar
* 100 grams (½ cup) lightly packed light brown sugar
* 3 teaspoons vanilla bean paste or pure vanilla extract
* ½ teaspoon fine sea salt
* 215 grams (1 ¾ cups) all-purpose flour
* 1 cup chopped pecans
* 1 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips (or sub chocolate chunks/diamonds and chop them finer)

## Directions


1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees and place a baking sheet (13- by 18-inches with sides) near your workstation. In a large mixing bowl, mix the sugar, brown sugar, vanilla bean paste and melted butter and mix well. Add the salt and flour and stir just until combined. Fold in the pecans and chocolate chips.

1. Spoon the bark batter onto the ungreased baking sheet and use your fingers and/or an offset spatula to press into a thin, even layer. It should reach the edges of the pan.

1. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake until golden brown all over, 18 to 20 minutes, rotating once halfway during the baking time. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely in the pan.

1. Once cool, use your hands to gently break the cookie bark into small pieces. Store in an airtight container for up to several days. Before serving, you can dip the cookies into or drizzle them with melted dark chocolate and sprinkle with flaky sea salt.


### Notes

* **Variations:** You can spread and bake this dough in a smaller pan for a thicker cookie, or bake it longer for a darker, crunchier cookie.
* **Ingredients:** Use different nuts, or skip them, or try various kinds of chocolate.
* **Garnish:** Dip it in melted white or dark chocolate — with a partial dip, drizzling it with a fork or even putting the melted chocolate in a pastry bag. Add sprinkles if you want to glam it up for a cookie swap.
