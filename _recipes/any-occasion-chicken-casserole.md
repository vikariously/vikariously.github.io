A cozy, comfort-foody casserole that can be frozen in whole or in part for easy future dinner. Shredding a Costco chicken and mostly shelf-stable ingredients makes this an easy prep-for-later dish.

**Cooking Time:** 40 min

**Preheat:** 375°F

## Ingredients

* 1 (7oz) pkg Herb Stuffing Mix
* ~half stick melted butter
* 3+ cups shredded cooked chicken
* 1 small yellow onion, chopped
* 1 can sliced waterchestnuts, drained and julienned into small pieces
* 2 cans cream of ________ soup (mushroom, celery, garlic & herb, mix-and-match)
* 1/2 cup milk (or half & half or heavy cream – we use Ripple Kids)

**Note:** this can be prepared in a 9x13 pan or two 8x8 pans. We typically do two 8x8's and freeze one for later.


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F.

1. Cook chicken breasts or use a roasted & shredded chicken to prepare the shredded meat.

1. Break down the stuffing mix into smaller pieces (e.g. using the "cookie hammer" method). Combine the stuffing mix with melted butter. Place 1/2 of the mixture in a casserole pan (or 1/4 each in two 8x8 pans). Set aside.

1. Mix chicken, water chestnuts, soup, onion, and milk/cream. Spread this mixture over the crumbs in the pan.

1. Top with the remaining crumb mixture.

1. Bake for 40 minutes.


### Notes

* **Freezing:** You can freeze this dish. Thaw overnight in the fridge and bake another time.
