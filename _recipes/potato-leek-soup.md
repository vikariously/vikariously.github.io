A warm and nourishing soup easy enough for week nights. We specifically like this no-cream recipe that keeps it hearty without the added fat.

**Total Time:** 45 minutes | **Yield:** 4 people

## Ingredients

* 1000g leeks (~2.2lb)
* 4 tbsp butter
* 2 tsp salt
* 1.2L chicken broth
* 600g potatoes
* 4 tsp dried mixed herbs
* 4 sprigs fresh thyme
* 4 bay leaves
* 60g parsley, chopped
* Black pepper to taste

##### Optional:

* Splash of your favourite hot sauce
* Serrano ham
* Chilli oil for garnish

## Directions


1. Cut the ends off the leeks, trim up the green parts and then cut them lengthways and into half circles. Include anything of the green part that you didn’t need to cut off. Wash thoroughly and rinse.

1. Get a pan on a medium heat and melt the butter. Add the leeks and salt. Cook for 10 minutes until soft with the lid on ajar.

1. Peel and cut the potatoes into cubes. Add the cubed potatoes to the pan with the broth, mixed herbs, thyme and bay leaves. Cook for 10 – 15 minutes on a low simmer with the lid on until the potatoes are soft.

1. Remove from the heat, discard the thyme and bay leaves. I like to have a creamy yet chunky soup, so I blend half the soup in small batches in a blender. This can also be done with a stick blender in the pot.

1. Add your hot sauce if using. Taste for seasoning and add more salt and pepper if needed.

1. Chop the parsley, add and stir in.

1. Serve in bowls and top with torn serrano ham, chilli oil (if using) and a little more freshly ground black pepper.
