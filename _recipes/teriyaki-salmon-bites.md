The oil & protein content in the mayonnaise combined with sugar from the teriyaki helps with the browning process, leaving these salmon bites tender, with a sweet and crispy finish to the outside. Yum!

**Total Time:** ~40 mins to 2.5 hrs (includes marinade time)

**Yield:** Serves 2-3

## Ingredients

* 1 lb Salmon, boneless+skinless, cut into ~1” to 1.5” cubes
* 2 Tbsp Teriyaki Sauce, plus more for serving
* 2 Tbsp Kewpie Mayo (can substitute regular mayo)
* 2 pinches salt
* Olive Oil, small drizzle
* Green Onions & Sesame Seeds, for garnish

## Directions


1. Cut salmon to size and put in a medium bowl.

1. Add Teriyaki Sauce, Kewpie, 1-2 pinches salt, and a small drizzle of olive oil and mix thoroughly. Refrigerate for 20 minutes up to 2 hours before cooking for marinade to take.

1. Place oven rack high in the oven (roughly 6” from the roof of the oven and broiler). Then set broiler to high and let it heat for ~5-10 minutes.

1. Line a baking sheet with foil (other materials like silicon and parchment should not go under a broiler) and space the salmon pieces evenly 1”-2” apart from each other.

1. Put salmon under broiler and cook for 8-10 minutes. Here, you’re balancing exterior browning and caramelizing with not overcooking the fish and drying it out – pull it as soon as it’s browned enough.

1. Remove, put over rice with green onions, sesame seeds, and more teriyaki – enjoy!


### Notes

* **Deeper Browning:** To achieve deeper browning without overcooking the fish, you can cut it into larger pieces so it takes longer to cook through while achieving the desired crispy finish.
* **Serving Recommendations:**
    * White Sticky Rice
    * Asian Pickled Cucumbers
    * Roasted Broccoli
