Serves 4-6 as a dinner side, but double the recipe if making for a party

## Ingredients

* 1 1/2 pounds fingerling potatoes (such as La Ratte or Russian Banana), cut into 1/2-inch disks
* Kosher salt
* 2 tablespoons white wine vinegar, divided
* 1 tablespoon whole grain mustard
* 2 tablespoons sour cream
* 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 small red onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)
* 2 scallions, finely sliced (about 1/4 cup)
* 1 tablespoon minced fresh dill (or more to taste)
* Freshly ground black pepper

## Directions


1. Place potatoes, 1 tablespoon salt, 1/2 tablespoon vinegar, and 3 cups tepid water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally until salt is dissolved. Reduce to a bare simmer and cook until potatoes are completely tender and show no resistance when poked with a paring knife or cake tester, about 17 minutes. Drain potatoes.

1. Immediately toss potato pieces with 1 tablespoon vinegar, spread in a single layer in a rimmed baking sheet, and allow to cool to warm room temperature, about 10 minutes.

1. Meanwhile, combine mustard, sour cream, olive oil, red onions, scallions, dill, and remaining 1/2 tablespoon vinegar in a large bowl and whisk together. Add potatoes and toss thoroughly to combine. Season to taste with more salt and pepper as necessary. Serve. 


### Notes

* Potato salad can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Allow to chill fully, then serve slightly cool.
