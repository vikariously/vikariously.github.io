I love a good cinnamon roll, but they can be a lot of work to make. This delectable, shareable, sticky-sweet cinnamon pull-apart bread uses off-the-shelf dough for a quick and easy answer to that problem!

![Constructing your bread](/images/cinnamon-monkey-bread-1.jpg)

## Ingredients

#### For the Bread:

* 1 lb. Trader Joe's fresh pizza dough
* ½ cup Brown Sugar
* ¼ cup Granulated White Sugar
* 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon
* ½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
* 1 tsp. vanilla extract

#### For the Icing:

* 2 cups powdered sugar, sifted (make sure you sift it!!)
* 3 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted 
* 2 tsp. vanilla
* 2 oz. milk

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F and grease a bundt pan. You can alternatively use a 9x5-inch loaf pan.

1. Allow the dough to come to room temperature for 5-10 minutes before using. This will allow it to rise a little, but keep it cool enough to work with easily – we will let it rest further after constructing.

1. In a small bowl, mix the brown sugar, white sugar, and cinnamon. In a separate bowl, stir the vanilla extract into the melted butter. Set both bowls aside.

1. Divide the dough into one-inch pieces. You can do this by flattening the dough and cutting it into strips, then chunks.

1. A few pieces at a time, roll each piece in the melted butter, and then in the cinnamon sugar. Layer them in the prepared bundt/loaf pan, and allow to sit at room temp for another 15-30 minutes.

1. Bake for 30 minutes, until lightly browned (up to 40 minutes, but you risk it getting a bit hard).

1. To make the icing, combine sifted powdered sugar, melted butter, vanilla, and milk in a large mixing bowl until smooth.

1. Allow to cool for 5-10 minutes before flipping onto a plate to serve. You can drizzle with icing or serve on the side for dipping / self-drizzling!


### Notes

* **For larger groups:** Got a lot of mouths to feed? If you're using a bundt pan, you can 1.5x or possibly even 2x this recipe. At 1.5x, 30min of bake time should still be sufficient, but if doubling, it may require closer to 35-40 minutes.

* **Make the icing ahead of time:** You can make the icing the night before to cut down on work day-of. If you do this, be sure to let it come to room temperature before serving (or even warm up by double-boiling).
