Delicious, flavorful chicken thighs – a perfect base for use in any Mexican entree.

## Ingredients

##### Achiote Marinade

* ½ cup orange juice (freshly squeezed)
* ¼ cup lime juice (freshly squeezed)
* ¼ cup grapeseed oil
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 3 cloves garlic
* 2 teaspoons Mexican oregano
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 2 ounces achiote powder
* 2 teaspoons onion powder

##### Chicken

* 3 pounds chicken thighs (boneless and skinless)
* 3 tablespoons vegetable oil

## Directions


1. **Make the marinade:** Add all the marinade ingredients together to a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.

1. **Marinate the chicken:** Place the chicken in a large bowl and pour the marinade over the chicken. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate for at least 2 hours to overnight.

1. **Preheat grill pan:** Preheat a grill pan over medium-high heat then add the vegetable oil and heat. If using an outdoor grill, preheat it to 350°F.

1. **Cook the chicken:** Cook the chicken thighs in batches, for about 3 to 5 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the thighs. If using the outdoor grill, grill the chicken covered for about 20 to 30 minutes, flipping once halfway through. The chicken is cooked through when an instant-read thermometer registers at 165°F to 175°F when inserted in the thickest part of each thigh.


### Notes

* **Toaster Oven Method:** I'm going to try making these in the Toaster Oven: 400 Convection | 8min / flip / 8min. USE FOIL for cleanup
