## Ingredients

* 3 pounds pork shoulder roast
* Kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* 4 yellow onions, thinly sliced
* 6 cloves garlic, minced
* ¼ cup dry white wine
* 1 tablespoon fresh thyme, or use 1 teaspoon dried thyme
* 1 tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary leaves, or use 1 teaspoon crushed dried rosemary
* 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
* 1½ cups Apple Cider, NOT Apple Cider Vinegar
* 1½ cups low sodium chicken broth
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 granny smith apples, cored and quartered

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 400˚F.
1. Pat dry the pork with paper towels and season all over with kosher salt and black pepper.
1. Heat the oil in a large oven-safe Dutch oven set over medium-high heat. To the heated oil, add the pork and brown it on all sides; about 5 minutes per side.
1. Remove the pork from the pot and set it aside.
1. Add onions to the pot and cook over medium heat for about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring often, until softened. Stir in the garlic and cook for 20 seconds.
1. Deglaze the pot with the wine, scraping up all the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Then, stir in the thyme, rosemary, and paprika.
1. Add the pork back to the pot. Add in the apple cider, chicken broth, and bay leaves; bring the mixture to a boil.
1. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid and transfer the pork to the oven.
1. Reduce the oven temperature to 350˚F and cook for 2 hours.
1. Remove the lid from the pot and drop in the apples. Cover and continue to cook in the oven for 30 minutes or until the internal temperature of the pork registers at least 145˚F and up to 200˚F.
1. Remove from the oven and return the pot to the stovetop. Remove the pork from the pot and transfer it to a cutting board; let it rest for 10 minutes.
1. In the meantime, set the pot over high heat and bring it to a boil; cook for a couple minutes or until sauce is slightly reduced and thickened.
1. Cut the pork and serve it with the sauce, onions, and apples.
