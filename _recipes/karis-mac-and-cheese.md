[INTRO PARAGRAPH HERE]

## Ingredients

* 16 Ounces Uncooked Pasta - highly recommend shells (and the larger the better!)
* 4 Cups Chicken Broth
* 2 Tablespoons Butter/Margarine
* 1 Teaspoon Hot Pepper Sauce (any hot sauce is fine here but DON’T omit it)
* 1 Teaspoon Garlic Powder
* 1/2 Teaspoon Pepper
* 1/2 Teaspoon Salt
* 2 Cups Shredded Cheddar Cheese (we use a combo of sharp and aged)
* 1 Cup Shredded Mozzarella Cheese
* 1/2 Cup Grated Parmesan Cheese
* 1/2 Cup Milk (but typically don’t use more than just a splash)
* Up to ¼ cup bread crumbs

## Directions


1. Add the uncooked macaroni, chicken broth, butter, hot sauce, garlic powder, pepper, and salt to the Instant Pot.

1. Place the lid on the pot and set to sealing. Cook on manual function, high pressure for 5 minutes. Then, do a quick release.

1. Add the milk, then the cheese to the pot in 3-4 handfuls, stirring in between each addition until smooth and creamy. If the sauce is too wet, slowly add bread crumbs until the cheese sticks to the shells
