Fresher than your standard fiesta salad fare, we're subbing out the usual tortilla strips and getting our crunch from thin-sliced radishes instead. Meanwhile, the sweet red butter lettuce, pistachios, and seeds add some depth and complexity. This one was a big hit at our last Summer gathering!

## Ingredients

* Fresh cilantro, chopped
* 50/50 mix greens
* Red butter lettuce
* Red & yellow cherry tomatoes
* Radishes, thinly sliced
* Jalapeño-lime pistachios
* 1/2 bag pumpkin seeds or pepitas
* Queso fresco (can serve on side)

##### Dressing

* 1/2 olive oil
* 1/2 meyer lemon
* White balsamic
* Salt & pepper, to taste

## Directions


1. Wash and dry the 50-50 mix and red butter lettuce. Tear into bite-sized pieces if necessary.

1. Slice the radishes thinly and halve the cherry tomatoes. Chop the cilantro.

1. In a large bowl, combine the lettuces, cilantro, tomatoes, radishes, pistachios, and pumpkin seeds.

1. **Make the dressing:** Whisk together the olive oil, Meyer lemon juice, and white balsamic vinegar aggressively, until thoroughly combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

1. Serve the salad with the dressing, and the Queso Fresco on the side (or crumbled on top).
