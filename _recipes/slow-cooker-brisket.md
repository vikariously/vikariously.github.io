A hearty meal that will make the whole house smell good all day, and something our family has made for many Christmas dinners. Excellent served with mashed potatoes or [Ina's Potato Basil Potatoes](/recipes/potato-basil-puree). Leftovers can also make you a [Brisket & Vegetable Pot Pie](/recipes/brisket-pot-pie).

## Ingredients

* 6 pounds beef brisket (point/deckle - if you can get it)
* 1 Tbsp Kosher or sea salt
* ¼ tsp ground black pepper
* 1 tsp dried oregano
* ½ tsp dried thyme
* 1 tsp paprika
* 2 Tbsp olive oil
* 3 onions, peeled and sliced
* 3 celery sticks, cut into 2-inch chunks
* 4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1-2 inch chunks
* 6 garlic cloves, chopped finely
* 8 ounces beer (not dark) - we used Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale
* 1 (28-ounces) can crushed tomatoes
* ¼ cup chicken broth or beef stock (2oz)
* 3 bay leaves

##### Optional:

* Chopped Parsley for garnishing (optional)

## Directions


1. If using an oven and not Slow Cooker, preheat the oven to 300 degrees Fahrenheit. 

1. Pat the brisket dry. In a small bowl mix the salt, black pepper, oregano, thyme and paprika. Rub the brisket with the spice mix.

1. In a large roasting pan or Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. The oil should be hot but not smoking. Brown the meat on all sides, about 10 minutes total. You should have a nice golden crust. Transfer the meat to the slow cooker - try to get as flat as possible and make sure the fatty side is up.

1. Add the onions, celery and carrots to the pot and cook stirring frequently for about 5 minutes. The onions should start getting soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook for an additional 2 minutes. 

1. Add the beer and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to release all the brown bits. Bring to a boil. Add the crushed tomatoes and broth. Mix well to combine. Place on top of meat, 

1. Slow cook on low for 8 hours. 

1. Remove bay leaves.

1. Serve to the happiest people on earth


### Notes

* **Oven-cooked Variation:** If you'd prefer to do this in the oven instead of a slow cooker, see the original recipe link below for those instructions.
