This Shawarma Chicken seasoning & marinade is warm and complex. When I was first testing this recipe, I was nervous adding so many pungeant spices to the blend, but they come together extremely well!

This recipe can also be cooked several ways. You can do a simple marinade and then cook the chicken any way you normally would (grill, pan, bake, etc.), or you can layer the marinaded chicken in a loaf pan and bake to create that authentic "layered & shaved" shawarma character.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into smaller pieces
* 1 lb boneless skinless chicken thighs
* ¼ cup olive oil
* 3 tablespoons lemon juice (1.5 oz)
* 3 Tbsp of Shawarma Spice Blend (1½ Tbsp per pound of chicken)

### Shawarma Spice Blend

* 1 Tbsp Garlic Powder
* ½ Tbsp Salt
* 1 tsp paprika
* ¾ tsp cumin
* ¼ tsp crushed red pepper
* ¼ tsp cinnamon
* ¼ tsp Ground Clove
* ¼ tsp cardamom

## Directions

1. Marinade chicken for at least 1-2 hours, up to 24 hours (overnight). 

1. If you are grilling/frying/baking chicken, do so as you normally would. If making in a loaf pan, read on.

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F.

1. Line a 9x5 loaf pan with parchment paper, so that a small amount of the paper comes up around the edge that you can use to pull it out at the end.

1. Line a 9×5 inch loaf pan with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together all of the spices.

1. Layer the chicken in the loaf pan and press down at the end. Bake for 40-45 minutes – use a thermometer to ensure you've hit 165 in the center. Remove from oven and let it rest for 10 minutes to soak up the juices.

1. Turn the pan over onto a cutting board and slice the chicken as you need it.

### Notes

* **Thighs vs. Breasts:** You can make this recipe with either light or dark meat, depending on your preferences. I prefer thighs if grilling, breasts if sous vide, and if baking in a loaf pan I find half-and-half hits the spot between juicy and lean. It's really up to your taste and preference!

* **Chicken Alternatives:** This seasoning blend works great for any kind of Mediterranean main – try roasting Cauliflower with it for a vegetarian alternative!

* **4x Shawarma Spice Blend:** You can make the Shawarma seasoning in a much larger batch and keep it on-hand: 
  * 4 Tbsp Garlic Powder
  * 2 Tbsp Salt
  * 1½ Tbsp paprika
  * 1 Tbsp cumin
  * 1 tsp crushed red pepper
  * 1 tsp cinnamon
  * 1 tsp Ground Clove
  * 1 tsp cardamom
