A fantastic, healthy meal with year-round ingredients, but especially perfect for Fall. We like it with sausage crumbles, but if you’d prefer a vegetarian dish, substitute 2 Tbsp Olive Oil instead of sausage fat renderings. Leftovers can be served for breakfast with a fried egg topper and hot sauce!

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. Italian Sausage (hot or mild, pork or chicken)
* 2 large Sweet Potatoes
* 1 lb. Brussels Sprouts, quartered (or halved depending on size)
* 1 Bunch (or bag) of chopped adult/dino Kale, stems removed
* 1 large Leek, cut in half and thinly sliced to make tiny thin moons
* 1 large Yellow Onion, chopped
* Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning (or Salt), Pepper, and Garlic Powder


## Directions


1. Preheat the oven to 425°F (400°F convect).

1. Quarter the brussels and cut sweet potato to similar size

1. toss the brussels & sweet potato in olive oil and spice mix

1. Place on a baking sheet or in 9x13 dish and bake for approx 35 minutes, until sweet potatoes begin to soften

1. in a large saute pan, cook the sausage on high heat, breaking into as small of chunks as possible while browning and rendering out fat

1. Carefully drain and remove sausage bits, leaving as much of the rendered fat in the pan as possible

1. If you want it spicy, and could only find mild, add Crushed Red Pepper

1. Saute onions in the renderings on high heat until translucent and beginning to carmelize

1. Reduce to medium heat (~4), add the leeks to the pan, and season with more of the spice mix

1. Shortly after the leeks begin to cook (5-8 minutes) add in the kale to wilt it, stir

1. Set all aside until sweet potato mixture is ready

1. Take all ingredients, mix together in large bowl

1. Return the mixture to your large baking dish.

1. Bake the combined ingredients an additional 10 minutes. Then, broil a final 2-4 minutes to desired crispyness-of-top, Watch carefully!
