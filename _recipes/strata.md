This "Anything Goes" Strata is our go-to answer when we've got an assortment of things in the fridge we need to use up – especially bread that's going stale. Don't take the recipe below as gospel: the correct answer is any combination of veggies, meat, bread, and cheese you've got on hand. We've made bacon, broccoli, cheddar, and we've made chicken, sundried tomato, and parmesan – you really can't go wrong!

## Ingredients

* Butter or nonstick cooking spray, for greasing pan
* 10 large eggs
* 1 cup milk
* Dash of ground nutmeg
* Dash of cayenne pepper
* Kosher salt
* ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* 1 onion, diced (*optional*)
* 3 handfuls dark, leafy greens such as spinach, arugula or baby kale, chopped (about 1 cup packed)
* 1 cup diced salty deli meat, such as Canadian bacon, ham, or cooked bacon. You can also use turkey, shredded chicken, etc.
* 8 ounces (about 2 1/2 packed cups) leftover bread torn into 1-inch pieces, such as sourdough or white bread, English muffins, bagels, hot dog buns, etc. 
* 3/4 cup shredded mild melting cheese such as Gruyere, Cheddar, Provolone or Gouda. Parmesan works nicely on the top here as well.


## Directions

1. Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 350°F (if baking the next day, skip this step).

1. Grease a 9x13 baking dish with butter or cooking spray.

1. Whisk the eggs, milk, nutmeg, cayenne, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper together in a large bowl. Fold the greens, meat, bread and 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese into the mixture. 

1. Pour into the prepared baking dish and top with the remaining cheese.

1. Cover with foil and bake for 35 minutes. Uncover and bake until the strata is puffed, golden brown at the edges and set in the center, with very minimal, if any wetness, between 20-35 minutes more. Let cool 10 minutes before serving.


### Notes

* **Make-ahead Instructions:** We often make this the night before to bake the next morning. To do this, prepare as instructed above, then spray a piece of foil with cooking spray and cover (so cheese doesn't stick as it cooks). The next morning, remove from fridge and let sit at room temperature for 15-20 minutes while oven preheats, then bake as normal.

* **1/2 size:** You can make this recipe in an 8x8 by cutting it in ~half (but why would you?).
