**Note:** This recipe is taken entirely from the Serious Eats version, we just don't make the gravy and have added some of our own notes for our preferences. It is highly recommended to see the full Serious Eats article: [Sous Vide Turkey Breast with Crispy Skin](https://www.seriouseats.com/sous-vide-turkey-breast-crispy-skin-recipe-thanksgiving)

Perfectly moist turkey breast cooked sous vide with impossibly crispy skin and rich gravy. This method eliminates the guesswork and delivers consistent results every time, making it ideal for Thanksgiving or any special occasion.

[//]: # ½ ¼ ¾ ⅓ ⅔

## Ingredients

* 1 large whole skin-on, bone-in turkey breast (about 5 pounds)
* Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning

## Directions

In this recipe, the skin and breasts are cooked completely separately, ensuring both perfectly moist turkey and smokey, crispy skin. Both can be prepped ahead of time (see notes at bottom)

### Crispy Turkey Skin:

1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

1. Spread skin evenly over a piece of parchment paper set in a rimmed baking sheet. Season generously with salt and pepper. Place a second sheet of parchment on top and carefully squeeze out any air bubbles using the side of your hand. Place a second rimmed baking sheet on top and transfer to oven.

1. Roast until skin is deep brown and crisp (it will crisp further on cooling), 30 to 45 minutes. Allow to cool and set aside at room temperature.


### Prepare & Cook the Turkey Breasts:

1. Carefully remove turkey skin in a single piece and set aside. Using a sharp boning knife, remove breast meat from breastbone. Set breastbone aside.

1. Season turkey medium-generously with Creole Seasoning – this is literally the only thing I put on it. Place 1 breast half, cut side facing up, on a work surface. Place second breast half facedown, so the fat end aligns with the skinny end of the first breast half (tl;dr: 69 them). Gently form into an even cylinder.

1. Tie turkey breast at 1-inch intervals using butcher's twine. Transfer to a zipper-lock bag. Turkey can be refrigerated for up to 5 days before proceeding.

#### Cook the Turkey (Sous Vide):

1. Heat a sous vide water bath to 140°F, or to desired temperature according to the temperature table below.

1. With bag open, slowly lower bagged turkey into water, letting water pressure squeeze air out of bag until just the seal remains above the waterline. Seal bag completely.

1. Let turkey cook for 3 hours (or according to temperature table below). If you have not already, make the crispy skin.

#### Finish and Serve:

1. When turkey is cooked, remove from water bath and unseal bag. Carefully remove butcher's twine.

1. Cut into ¼- to ½-inch slices for serving. Fan slices out on a warmed serving platter or cutting board. Break skin into serving-sized pieces and add to platter, along with a pitcher of gravy. Serve immediately.

### Notes

#### Sous Vide Temperature & Time Guide:

| Final Result | Bath Temp | Core Temp | Cook Time After Reaching Core | Approx. Total Cook Time |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| Very pink, soft, extra moist | 132°F (56°C) | 130°F (55°C) | 2 hours | 4 hours |
| Pale pink, soft, moist | 138°F (59°C) | 136°F (58°C) | 1 hour | 3 hours |
| White, tender, moist | 145°F (63°C) | 143°F (62°C) | 16 minutes | 2½ hours |
| White; traditional roast texture | 152°F (67°C) | 150°F (66°C) | 4 minutes | 2 hours |

* **Crispy Skin Make-Ahead:** Turkey skin can be roasted in advance, cooled completely, then stored, loosely covered, at room temperature for up to 3 days. To re-crisp, place in a hot oven for a few minutes just before serving.
* **Make-Ahead Turkey:** The cooked turkey can be chilled in an ice bath and stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. Reheat it in a 130°F (55°C) water bath for about an hour before serving.
