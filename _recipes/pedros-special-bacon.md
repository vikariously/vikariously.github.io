Delivered unto me years ago by a man named Pedro who was cookin' up some incredible BLTs out of a food truck, I've kept his name on it to this day!

## Ingredients

* 1.5 lb. Thick Cut Bacon 
* ½ cup Brown Sugar, loosely packed
* 1 Tbsp fresh Rosemary, finely minced 
* 1 tsp freshly ground Black Pepper (optional)

**Note:** you can scale this down to 1 lb., especially if you're trying to fit it all on one pan.

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 400°F

1. Mix brown sugar, minced rosemary, and black pepper in a small bowl

1. Place an oven-safe wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet, and lay your bacon strips out on the rack – this will allow the fat to drip off the bacon as it cooks, and get you a crispier result. You may need a 2nd baking sheet + rack to fit all the bacon at once

1. Sprinkle some of the seasoning mixture on each slice of bacon and gently rub in, then flip each slice of bacon and repeat.

1. Bake at 400°F for about 40 minutes – you'll need to use your judgement and scale time up/down depending on how crispy you want it.
