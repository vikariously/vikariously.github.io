One of the old Google cafes used to make these, and I had a hard time resisting them. So, I asked them for the recipe, and voila – now I have to resist _making_ them, and not just eating them!

## Ingredients

* 1 cup salted butter softened
* 2 cup light brown sugar packed
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 2 large eggs
* 3 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* ½ tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 1 cups white chocolate chips (or white chocolate chunks)
* ½ cup rainbow sprinkles

## Directions


1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper and set aside.

1. In a separate bowl mix flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder. Set aside.

1. Cream together butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

1. Beat in eggs and vanilla until combined.

1. Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.

1. Add chocolate chips and rainbow sprinkles and mix well.

1. Roll 2-3 TBS (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets. (alternately, use a small cookie scoop to make your cookies)!

1. Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just BARELY starting to turn brown.

1. Let them sit on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.
