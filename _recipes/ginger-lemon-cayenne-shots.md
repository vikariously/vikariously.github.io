With a zing and a kick, this is my favorite way to use up an abundance of Meyer lemons.

## Ingredients

- 12 oz. Meyer Lemon Juice
- 50g fresh Ginger Root (weight post-peeling)
- Â¼ tsp Cayenne Pepper, or more/less to taste
- 1 Tbsp Honey, or more to taste
- (_optional_) 20g fresh Turmeric Root (weight post-peeling)

## Directions

1. Blend all ingredients, then strain through a fine mesh, ensuring you press as much juice out of the ginger pulp as possible. 

1. Store in the fridge up to one week, or freeze (e.g. in ice cubes that you can thaw).

### Notes

* **Peeling Ginger & Turmeric Tip:** you can use a spoon to shred off the skin of the ginger. Works like a charm and you lose a lot less of the flesh compared to using a knife.
* **Substituting Regular Lemons:** if you have or prefer to use regular lemon juice, I recommend upping the Honey to 1.5 or 2 Tbsp to balance it being more tart / less sweet than Meyer Lemon juice.
