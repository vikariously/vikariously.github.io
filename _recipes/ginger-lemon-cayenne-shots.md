With a zing and a kick, this is my favorite way to use up an abundance of Meyer lemons.

## Ingredients

- 12 oz. Meyer Lemon Juice
- 50g fresh Ginger Root (weight post-peeling)
- Â¼ tsp Cayenne Pepper
- 2 tsp Honey 

## Directions

1. Blend all ingredients, then strain through a fine mesh, ensuring you press as much juice out of the ginger pulp as possible. 

1. Store in the fridge up to one week, or freeze (e.g. in ice cubes that you can thaw).

### Notes

* **Peeling Ginger Tip:** you can use a spoon to shred off the skin of the ginger. Works like a charm and you lose a lot less of the flesh compared to using a knife.
