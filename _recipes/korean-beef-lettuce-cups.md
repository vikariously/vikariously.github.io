A fast, easy, delicious weeknight dinner, these Korean Beef Lettuce Cups use mostly ingredients right out of the pantry. Delicious with some quick pickled veggies or kimchi and rice! You can also mix it up and prepare this as a rice bowl instead of lettuce cups.

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. Ground Beef (10% fat or lower preferred)
* 1 head Butter Lettuce
* ¼ cup brown sugar, packed
* ¼ cup reduced sodium soy sauce
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* ½ tsp crushed red-pepper flakes, or more to taste
* 1 Tbsp freshly grated ginger (or substitute ¼ tsp ground ginger)
* 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 green onions, thinly sliced, plus more for garnish
* Sesame seeds (garnish)

Serve with:

* white rice
* pickled veggies
* kimchi

## Directions

1. In a small bowl, whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes and ginger.

1. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.

1. Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; drain excess fat well.

1. Stir in soy sauce mixture and green onions until well combined, allowing to simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.

1. Serve immediately, garnished with green onion and sesame seeds, if desired.
