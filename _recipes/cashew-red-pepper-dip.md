This recipe takes some forethought to soak the cashews, but the end result is a delicious, creamy, dip perfect for crudités, crispy brussels, or with Mediterranean.

## Ingredients

* 3/4 cup Cashews, soaked "overnight"
* 1 red bell pepper
* 1 clove garlic
* 2-3 fl. oz. non-dairy milk (Ripple, almond, oat, etc.)
* 1/2 tsp salt

## Directions

1. Soak cashews until very soft and plump with water – 8+ hours (see Notes!)

1. Roast the red pepper - quarter it and lightly coat with olive oil. Place skin-up on baking sheet and roast at 450° (ideally 425° convection) for 10-20 min, until desired char is achieved on skin

1. Blend all ingredients. Adjust milk as needed for desired consistency.

### Notes

* **Soaking Cashews:** The main caution with the overnight method of soaking cashews is that you don't want to soak them for too long. After 16 hours or so, I find they start to get a bit slimy. I suggest rinsing and refreshing your water after 12 hours if you aren't yet ready to use them. After 16 hours, if the cashews are gel-like and really slimy (say you forget about them completely), recommend tossing them.
