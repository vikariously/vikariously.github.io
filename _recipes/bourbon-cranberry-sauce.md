A family favorite, courtesy of The Late Late Show with James Corden! So good, we usually make a double batch in a 9x13.

## Ingredients

* 1 12oz bag of Cranberries
* 1¼ cups Granulated Sugar
* ¼ tsp Ground Cinnamon
* 1 pinch Nutmeg
* ¼ cup Bourbon (start with 1 oz. and taste, before adding more)

## Directions


1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.

1. Combine the cranberries, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a small baking dish and cover. Bake for approximately 55 minutes.

1. Remove the cover and stir to melt any undissolved sugar. Return the dish to the oven, uncovered, and bake for 5 more minutes (or until the cranberries are soft and surrounded by a syrupy sauce).

1. Remove the dish from the oven and immediately stir in the bourbon – start with 1 oz and taste, before adding more. Let the dish cool to room temperature, then chill for at least 1 hour before serving.


### Notes

* **Bourbon:** You really can't go wrong with either a traditional bourbon (to lean sweeter) or rye whiskey (for a bit more dry/spice character). However, I would personally lean away from a sour mash.
