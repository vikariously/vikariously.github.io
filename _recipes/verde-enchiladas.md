The full name of these used to be "Bargain Bin-chiladas", because we'd make them with ingredients from the Grocery Outlet Bargain Market by our house. Over time however, these have been honed from a "kitchen sink tray meal" into a gourmet, vegetable-forward masterpiece... The addition of Poblano Pepper and Fire Roasted Corn really elevates these, even if they may be a bit less of a bargain now.

## Ingredients

* 28 oz can Las Palmas (or other) green Chile enchilada sauce
* Shredded chicken (2 cups minimum, and should be dry, like rotisserie chicken leftovers)
* 1 fresh Poblano Pepper, chopped ¼ inch squares OR small can diced green chilies
* 1 Yellow Onion (can substitute White Onion)
* 1-2 cups Power Greens, Spinach or Baby Kale (optional, but recommended)
* 1 can Fire Roasted Corn (optional)
* Aged Cheddar Cheese
* 2-4 T Renfro’s Green Salsa (or another verde salsa)
* 6-8 Whole wheat carb balance tortillas (or other tortillas, recommend flour and medium size)
* Cumin
* Tony’s creole seasoning

##### Serve with any of the following:

* Refried Black Beans
* Slided Avocado
* Fresh Cherry Tomatoes, halved
* Your favorite salsa!

## Directions


1. Preheat oven to 350

1. Cover 13x9 pan with layer of enchilada sauce (approx ⅓)

1. **Filling:** Saute onions and poblano until translucent (if using canned chilies do not saute), then add generous shake of garlic powder and cumin, and saute another 1-2 minutes

1. Add greens (if using) and saute until greens are wilted

1. Add the salsa, shredded chicken, green chilies, Tony’s and a small handful of cheddar

1. Slightly heat tortillas to make them pliable for rolling

1. Make 8 (or as many as fit with your filling - I line two across the top of a 9x13 dish)

1. Cover with remaining sauce, plus about half cup each cheddar and pepper jack on top

1. Cook for 25 mins - under foil, but remove the foil for last ten mins

1. Broil for 2-3 mins if you want extra crispy/burnt cheese bits on top
