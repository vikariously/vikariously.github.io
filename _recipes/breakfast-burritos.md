BLURB

## Ingredients

* 12 Eggs
* ¾ c. Aged Cheddar Cheese, grated
* ½ c. Shredded mix cheese (we usually use mexican blend)
* 1lb frozen tater tots
* ~8 strips bacon (a few strips shy of 1lb)
  * **Note:** you can omit this to keep it vegetarian friendly, if you do, use olive oil instead of bacon renderings to cook onions & greens
* 1 large or 2 small red onions (don’t skimp here! But you can substitute white or yellow onions if you prefer)
* 4-5 oz greens (most/all of a small clamshell) - power greens, spinach, baby kale, etc.
* 1 Tbsp Everything Bagel seasoning (up to 1.5 Tbsp to taste)
* 8 large (burrito sized) Mission Carb Balance tortillas (6 to a package, requires 1⅓ packages)

## Directions

1. Heat oven and cook tater tots as directed (you can work on other steps while they’re cooking).
1. Prep some ingredients: Dice red onion. Crack eggs into a bowl and scramble, adding a small amount of salt+pepper if preferred.
1. Allow the tater tots to cool a bit after removing from oven, then smash them up into crumbles in a large mixing bowl. Add both cheeses and Everything Bagel seasoning.
1. In a large skillet, cook the bacon until just-shy-of-crispy, rendering out all the fat. Remove bacon, pat dry, and cut into small pieces. Retain several Tablespoons of rendered bacon fat in the pan, discard the rest (we use an empty pickle jar for this).
1. Add the diced onion to the hot bacon fat, and cook over medium heat until starting to soften, about 8-10 minutes. Then, reduce to medium-low, add the greens and saute until wilted, about 2 minutes. (if you're making vegetarian, just use olive oil)
1. Once onions & greens are softened, add the whisked eggs to the pan and carefully attend, ensuring the eggs stay soft and do not dry out. It’s preferable to undercook the eggs a bit, as these burritos will be reheated later.
1. Add the eggs & veggies and the chopped bacon to the mixing bowl and stir to combine everything. You can assemble right out of the bowl, but I prefer to spread the mixture onto a large cutting board into a big uniform rectangle, then divide into 8 smaller rectangles using a spatula to equally portion each burrito’s filling.
1. Get out your tortillas and microwave them slightly to soften – 4 at a time for 30 seconds, assemble 4 burritos, then microwave the last 4 tortillas and assemble. Wrap each burrito in foil
1. Burritos can be kept in the fridge for up to 1 week, or placed in freezer zip-loc and frozen for up to 3 months (they will not last this long). 
  * Note: we typically leave 4 in the fridge for the first week, and freeze 4 to be thawed in a week’s time!

### Reheating Instructions

**From Fridge:** punch several holes in the burrito, then wrap in a paper towel. Place on a microwave safe plate and heat on medium-high for ~2:30
**From Freezer:** This will vary based on your microwave! We use the defrost setting for 3-4 minutes, then cook for ~2:30 on medium high.
