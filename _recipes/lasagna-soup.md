I love lasagna, but I don't always want that much noodles & ricotta... enter: _Lasagna Soup_. Packed with healthy greens, tomatoes, mushrooms, and your choice of ground & browned protein (we prefer italian sausage), this dish gives you all the flavors you crave from a lasagna in a much less heavy package!

## Ingredients

* 2 teaspoons olive oil
* 1-1.5 pounds Italian sausage, lean ground beef, or ground turkey
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* 5 cloves garlic, minced
* 10oz sliced crimini mushrooms
* 5oz power greens, baby spinach, or baby kale (about one bag or small clamshell, or more to taste!)
* 4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth if you’re going veg)
* 2 cups marinara sauce
* 1 15oz can diced tomatoes
* ½ T italian seasoning
* ½ t additional dried or fresh basil
* ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (less or more depending on your heat preference, if you used spicy sausage, etc)
* 8 lasagna noodles (broken into 1-2 inch pieces, shape doesn't matter)
* ½ cup freshly grated parmesan
* 1 cup grated mozzarella


## Directions

1. Turn on the Sauté function on the Instant Pot and heat the olive oil, if using. Add the ground meat and cook until no longer pink (about 7-8 minutes), breaking it up into smaller pieces. Discard the excess oil, if needed, leaving just a thin layer (tip: you can use a paper towel to soak it up, rather than draining it). Add the onion and sauté another couple minutes until they are starting to soften and become fragrant. Add mushrooms and garlic, and saute for another 3-4 minutes, until mushrooms start to shrink and brown. Turn off the sauté function.
1. Add a small amount of the broth and deglaze the bottom of the insert (using a spatula, scrape up any brown bits that are stuck - DONT skip this step). Add the remaining broth, marinara sauce, diced tomatoes, basil, italian seasoning, and red pepper flakes. Add the broken lasagna noodles and push them down into the liquid until just submerged (you dont want them to touch the bottom, but make sure they are not clumped together). Put on the lid, set it to sealing and cook on Manual high pressure for 6 minutes. 
1. At the end of pressure cooking time, quick release the pressure. Stir in the greens and try to break up any remaining clumps of noodles using two forks.
1. We recommend serving the mozzarella and parmesan as garnish to avoid the cleaning disaster that is cheese in the instant pot. If you would like to add ricotta or balsamic vinegar as toppings, that step can be done as garnish as well. 

### Notes

* A little goes a long way with the cheese. I wouldn’t add more than a tablespoon of mozzarella to one individual bowl to start with. 
* You may need to add more broth and marinara when reheating leftovers, because the noodles will continue to absorb the broth when refrigerated. 
* This recipe was done in a 6-quart Instant Pot. 
* This recipe easily makes 6 generous bowls. It will serve more people as a side dish.
