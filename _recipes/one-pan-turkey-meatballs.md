A nice, hearty, one-pan meal that comes together surprisingly quickly for making your own meatballs (well, unless you make your own gnocchi too ðŸ˜‰ðŸ¥”).

## Ingredients

#### For the Gnocchi/Pan:

1Â½ pounds cherry tomatoes
1 pound uncooked gnocchi
â…“ cup chopped fresh basil
3 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for drizzling
2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoons dried oregano
Â½ teaspoon crushed red pepper
6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper

#### For the Meatballs:

* 1 pound ground turkey
* Â½ cup plain breadcrumbs
* â…“ cup chopped fresh basil
* 1Â½ teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon dried oregano
* Â½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
* Â¼ teaspoon crushed red pepper
* 2 garlic cloves, finely grated
* 1 large egg

## Directions
Â°
1. Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. In a 9x13-inch baking dish, combine all the gnocchi ingredients and toss to combine.

1. In a large bowl, combine all the meatball ingredients and stir until well incorporated. Scoop 2-tablespoon-sized meatballs, rolling with wet hands to smooth, and nestle into the gnocchi mixture. Drizzle with another 2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil.

1. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the gnocchi is al dente and the meatballs have cooked through. For more color, broil for 2 to 3 minutes, if desired. Gently stir to combine, then serve.
