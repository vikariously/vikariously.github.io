A beautifully sweet syrup infused with warm autumn spices. Perfect for Bourbon/Rye cocktails, coffee, or drizzled over pancakes, waffles, and desserts. The combination of cinnamon, nutmeg, and other spices with candied pear captures the cozy-spiced essence of fall in a bottle.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- 2 pears (Anjou, larger, not too ripe)
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 3 cinnamon sticks
- 1 star anise pod (_optional_)
- pinch nutmeg (_optional_)

**Note on Spices:** When first making this, we used 3 cinnamon sticks and the nutmeg. Next time, I'll be adding the Star Anise to see how it changes!

## Directions

1. **Combine Ingredients:** In a small to medium saucepan, combine the water, granulated sugar, brown sugar, diced pears, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, and other optional ingredients.

1. **Dissolve Sugar:** Place the saucepan over medium heat. Stir regularly until the sugar has completely dissolved into the water.

1. **Simmer and Infuse:** Once the sugar is dissolved, reduce the heat to low or medium-low. Let the mixture gently simmer (do not rapid boil) for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The pears will soften, and the liquid will thicken slightly and become beautifully infused with the pear and spices.

1. **Cool and Steep:** Remove the saucepan from the heat. Allow the syrup to cool down completely, leaving the pears and spices in the mixture to steep for another 15-30 minutes for a stronger flavor, or until it reaches room temperature.

1. **Strain:** Pour the syrup through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean jar or container, discarding the pears and spices. You can gently press the pears against the strainer with the back of a spoon to extract a little more liquid, but don't force the pulp through.

1. **Store:** Seal the jar and store the Spiced Pear Syrup in the refrigerator. It should last for about 2-3 weeks.

### Notes

* **Pear Selection:** You can use Anjou, Bosc, or Bartlett. Choose pears that are slightly firm rather than fully ripe – overly ripe pears will break down too much during simmering and make the syrup cloudy.
* **Spice Variations:** Feel free to adjust the spices to your preference. Adding a few whole cloves, ½ tsp. fresh chopped ginger, or a small piece of vanilla bean are other options to create interesting flavor variations.
