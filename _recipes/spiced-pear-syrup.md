A beautifully aromatic syrup infused with warm autumn spices and sweet pears. Perfect for cocktails, coffee, or drizzled over pancakes and desserts. The combination of cinnamon, star anise, and fresh ginger creates a complex, warming flavor that captures the essence of fall in a bottle.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup water
- 2 pears (Anjou, larger, not too ripe)
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 3 cinnamon sticks
- 1 star anise pod (_optional_)
- pinch nutmeg (_optional_)
- ½ teaspoon chopped fresh ginger (_optional_, can add a nice warmth)

[//]: # ½ ¼ ¾ ⅓ ⅔

## Directions

1. **Combine Ingredients:** In a small to medium saucepan, combine the water, granulated sugar, brown sugar, diced pears, cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, and other optional ingredients.

1. **Dissolve Sugar:** Place the saucepan over medium heat. Stir regularly until the sugar has completely dissolved into the water.

1. **Simmer and Infuse:** Once the sugar is dissolved, reduce the heat to low or medium-low. Let the mixture gently simmer (do not rapid boil) for about 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. The pears will soften, and the liquid will thicken slightly and become beautifully infused with the pear and spices.

1. **Cool and Steep:** Remove the saucepan from the heat. Allow the syrup to cool down completely, leaving the pears and spices in the mixture to steep for another 15-30 minutes for a stronger flavor, or until it reaches room temperature.

1. **Strain:** Pour the syrup through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean jar or container, discarding the pears and spices. You can gently press the pears against the strainer with the back of a spoon to extract a little more liquid, but don't force the pulp through.

1. **Store:** Seal the jar and store the Spiced Pear Syrup in the refrigerator. It should last for about 2-3 weeks.

### Notes

* **Pear Selection:** Choose pears that are slightly firm rather than fully ripe. Overly ripe pears will break down too much during simmering and make the syrup cloudy.
* **Spice Variations:** Feel free to adjust the spices to your preference. Adding a few whole cloves or a small piece of vanilla bean can create interesting flavor variations.
* **Serving Suggestions:** This syrup is excellent in hot toddies, mixed with bourbon or rum, stirred into coffee or tea, or used as a sweetener for fall cocktails.
