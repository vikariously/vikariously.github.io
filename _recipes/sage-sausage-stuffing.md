Hands down my favorite item on the Thanksgiving dinner table. The magic bread combination of oily focaccia and crappy hot dog buns are our secret ingredients to this holiday staple.

**Note:** Makes (1) 9x13 pan and (1) 8x8 pan full – this recipe is HUGE.


## Ingredients

* 2½ lbs bread, cut into 3/4-inch cubes (about 5 quarts)
  * We used Specialties’ Focaccia and white hot dog buns, it is an amazing combo
* 8 Tbsp butter (1 stick; 4 ounces; 115g)
* 1 1/2 pounds (680g) sage sausage, removed from casing (We used 50/50 hot and mild Italian)
* 1 large onion, finely chopped (about 12 ounces; 350g)
* 4 large ribs celery, finely chopped (about 12 ounces; 350g)
* 2 cloves garlic, minced or grated on a Microplane
* ¼ cup minced fresh sage leaves (or 2 teaspoons dried sage leaves)
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, if needed (see note above)
* 1 quart low-sodium homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken or turkey stock (4 cups; 1L), divided
* 3 whole eggs
* ¼ cup minced parsley leaves, divided

## Directions

1. Adjust oven racks to lower-middle and upper-middle positions. Preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Spread bread evenly over 2 rimmed baking sheets. Stagger trays on oven racks and bake until completely dried, about 50 minutes total, rotating trays and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool. Increase oven heat to 350°F (177°C).
1. In a largest skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat until foaming subsides (do not allow butter to brown), about 2 minutes. Add sausage and mash with a stiff whisk or potato masher to break up into fine pieces (largest pieces should be no bigger than 1/4 inch). Cook, stirring frequently, until only a few bits of pink remain, about 8 minutes. 
1. Add onion, celery, garlic, and sage and cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables are softened, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat and add half of chicken stock.
1. Whisk remaining chicken stock, eggs, and 3 tablespoons parsley in a medium bowl until homogeneous. Stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, slowly pour egg mixture into sausage mixture. Add bread cubes and fold gently until evenly mixed.
1. Use part of stuffing to stuff turkey, if desired (see note above). To cook remaining stuffing, transfer to a buttered 9- by 13-inch rectangular baking dish (or 10- by 14-inch oval dish), cover tightly with aluminum foil, and bake until an instant-read thermometer reads 150°F (66°C) when inserted into center of dish, about 45 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until golden brown and crisp on top, 15 to 20 minutes longer – we usually broil for a final 2-4 minutes to get _just_ the right amount of crisp.
1. Remove from oven, let cool for 5 minutes, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve. 


### Notes

* Our favorite bread combo is herbed focaccia and white hot dog buns, but it can be hard to find good focaccia.
