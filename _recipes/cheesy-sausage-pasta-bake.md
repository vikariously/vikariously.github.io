[INTRO PARAGRAPH HERE]

**Total Time:** 1 hr 25 min (Prep: 45 min, Cook: 40 min)

**Yield:** Serves 8

## Ingredients

* 1 lb Rigatoni, cooked according to package directions
* 1 lb Mild Italian sausage
* 9 oz Baby spinach
* 24 1/3 fl oz Marinara sauce
* 1 tsp Ground black pepper
* 1 cup Fresh basil, divided use
* 2 tbsp Salted butter
* 2 tbsp Unbleached, all-purpose flour
* 2 cups 2% milk
* 1/2 lb Whole milk fresh mozzarella bocconcini, drained
* 1 cup Shredded Italian style parmesan cheese, plus more for garnish

## Directions


1. Preheat oven to 375ºF.

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add sausage and cook until well browned and cooked through, then add in all of the spinach and half of the basil. Cook until spinach is wilted. Use other half of basil for garnish.

1. Add in marinara sauce and pepper, bring to a light simmer then remove from heat.

1. In a separate saucepan melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour to create a roux. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until roux resembles wet sand then whisk in the milk.

1. Continue to stir until sauce begins to thicken. Once sauce has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon, add in all of the cheese. Stir until cheese is melted. Once cheese has melted remove from heat.

1. Combine cooked pasta and sausage mixture together into a large baking dish, then pour béchamel sauce over pasta, and then cover with marinara sauce.

1. Bake in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes until the sauce is bubbly and browned. Allow pasta to rest for a few minutes before serving.

1. Serve with generous amount of Parmesan cheese and basil.
