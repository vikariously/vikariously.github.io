This recipe is our special "dump all the Christas Eve leftovers into a pot pie for Christmas Dinner" special! We use our side veg of Asparagus, Peas, and Red Onions mixed in with the [Slow Cooker Brisket](/recipes/slow-cooker-brisket) leftovers and gravy all chopped up, reduce with red wine, and you've got a whole new exciting meal. Serve with leftover [Basil Potato Puree](/recipes/basil-potato-puree).

## Ingredients

* Puff Pastry
* ~1 lb. leftover [Slow Cooker Brisket](/recipes/slow-cooker-brisket) (or other brisket & vegetables)
* "enough scoops" of leftover sauteed vegetables (we traditionally have Asparagus, Peas, and Red Onions)
* 1 cup Red Wine
* ¼ cup Flour
* 1-2 Eggs, for egg wash

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F
1. Measure the puff pastry to the size of the cast iron plus 1” around the full edge
1. Remove about 1 lb. of Brisket from the leftovers and chop into cubes, set aside
1. Take leftover side veggies and some of the “chunks” from the brisket sauce – crisp/warm these up in the cast iron in a flat layer
1. Once hot, add 1/4 cup of flour, coating the top of the vegetables
1. Add one cup of red wine, and additional brisket liquid to pan, bring to a boil
1. Remove from heat, cover with puff pastry, tucking the excess over the sides of the skillet as much as possible (this is what your 1” margin is for)
1. Egg wash the puff pastry and poke a few slits in the top
1. Bake at 425°F until golden brown, about 20-25 mins.
