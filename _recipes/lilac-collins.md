Floral and herbal, with a lovely lilac hue.

## Ingredients

* 2 oz. Empress Gin
* 1 oz. Meyer Lemon Juice
* Â¾ oz. Thyme Simple Syrup (recipe below)
* Club Soda

## Directions


1. Shake, then pour over ice in a Collins glass and top with club soda.

#### Thyme Simple Syrup

* 1 cup Water
* 1 cup Granulated White Sugar
* 8-10 sprigs fresh Thyme


1. Remove any woody stems from the thyme - you can use the rest as shorter stems or just leaves, as you prefer.

1. Add the sugar, water and thyme to a small pan and warm over a medium heat, stirring regularly to help the sugar dissolve. Only warm it enough to let the sugar dissolve and have the mixture just starting to simmer.

1. Remove the pan from the heat and allow the thyme to steep in the syrup for around 15-20 minutes as the syrup cools.

1. Pour the syrup through a fine strainer/sieve to hold back the thyme and store the syrup in a sealed bottle/jar in the fridge until needed.
