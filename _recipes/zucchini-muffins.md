These muffins are moist and fluffy with an incredible sweet spice character from the Demerara sugar topping. The kids absolutely love them, and they freeze/reheat extremely well for quick breakfasts that technically contain a vegetable.

## Ingredients

* 2 cups (188g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
* ¼ cup Flax Meal (you may choose to omit this, but if you do, add an additional 1/4 cup flour)
* ¾ teaspoon baking powder
* ¾ teaspoon baking soda
* ¾ teaspoon salt
* 1 Tbsp ground cinnamon
* ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
* ½ cup chopped walnuts (optional)
* ¾ cup (180ml) vegetable oil (or melted coconut oil)
* ¾ cup (150g) packed dark brown sugar
* ¾ cup (150g) granulated sugar
* 2 eggs, at room temperature
* 1 Tbsp pure vanilla extract
* 3 cups shredded zucchini (about 2 medium-large)
* Secret Ingredient: Demerara sugar for the top (about 1/2 Tbsp per muffin for 12 muffins, or 3/8 cup for loaf – don’t skimp here!)

## Directions

#### Muffins

1. Preheat oven to 425°F

1. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and walnuts together in a large bowl until thoroughly combined. Set aside. In a medium bowl, whisk the oil, brown sugar, granulated sugar, egg, vanilla, and zucchini together until combined. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Gently whisk until *just* combined; do not overmix. Batter will be semi-thick.

1. Place muffin liners in muffin pan – this recipe usually makes 12-18 muffins depending on size.

1. Spoon the batter evenly into each liner, filling each all the way to the top. Sprinkle Demerara sugar over the top of each muffin, creating a thin (or thick, I don't judge) layer.

1. Bake the muffins for 5 minutes at 425°F (218°C) then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an additional 13-16 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total time these muffins take in the oven is about 18-21 minutes, give or take. 

1. Allow the muffins to cool for 5 minutes in the muffin pan, then transfer to a wire rack to continue cooling.

#### Bread/Loaf

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). 

1. Prepare batter as instructed in Step 2 above for Muffins.

1. Grease a 9×5 (or 8×4) inch loaf pan. Spread the batter into prepared loaf pan, and top with a layer of the Demerara sugar. Bake for 45 – 55 minutes. (I like to loosely cover the bread with aluminum foil halfway through to prevent heavy browning on top.) Baking times vary so keep an eye on yours. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out *mostly* clean with zero raw batter. Remove the bread from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely before slicing.

1. Cover and store leftover bread at room temperature for up to 3-4 days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.

### Notes

* **Freezing & Reheating:** These muffins freeze very well in a ziploc bag to reheat for easy breakfasts or snacks. When reheating in the microwave, we do ~20 seconds on one side, roll over, then another ~20 seconds (YMMV depending on your microwave).
