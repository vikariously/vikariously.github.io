Crispy and with a rich cheesy flavor from the nutritional yeast. These are great on their own (even the kids love them), but even better with [Cashew Red Pepper Dip](/recipes/cashew-red-pepper-dip).

## Ingredients

* 1 lb. Brussels Sprouts
* ¾ tsp salt
* ½ tsp paprika 
* 1 tsp garlic powder 
* ¼ cup nutritional yeast
* Black pepper 


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (400°F Convection preferred)

1. In a large pot, bring water to a boil and add a pinch of salt. Par-boil brussels sprouts, roughly 10 minutes, until bright green. Then remove from water, drain, and set aside to cool.

1. Mix the rest of the ingredients together to form a spice blend.

1. Once brussels have cooled, spread them out individually on a baking sheet lined with a silicon baking mat (or similar), and smash them – you can use the bottom of a glass if you don't have a dedicated smashing implement. Then, sprinkle each sprout with spice mix and drizzle with olive oil.

1. Roast for 15-20 minutes, until desired crispy edges form.

### Notes

* **Applying Olive Oil & Spices:** I have not figured out the best way to do this yet, and I'm definitely still experimenting. The order of "Smash" | "Season" | "Spread on tray" could be done in any order really, with varying degrees of success. I may try smashing, then mixing in a bowl with spices/oil, then putting back on the tray next, but I'm worried they'll fall apart...
